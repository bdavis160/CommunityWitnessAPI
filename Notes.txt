REST framework: Jersey

-Basics-
REST API methods are tagged with @attributes before the name of the class or method to specify certain details about them.
These include @GET/@POST/@PUT/@DELETE to specify the kind of method, @Path to specify the url for that method, and
@Produces/@Consumes to specify the type of data they produce and consume over the wire.

Note that @Path's are relative to Path's above them, in that a methods path is relative to the path of it's class
and a class's path is relative to the path of the application.

I found the jersey docs for REST methods (linked above) really helpful for working on these.
